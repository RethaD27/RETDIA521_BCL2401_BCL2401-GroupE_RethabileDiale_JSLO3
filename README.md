# Example 1:
Is an imperative programming paradigm.
The code specifies the exact sequence of actions that need to be performed to achieve the desired outcome.
** How it follows an imperative programming:
The code begins by declaring and initialising the variables grill temperature and steak temperature to 0 deg, in order to store the temperature of the grill and steak respectively.
The code proceeds to perform the steps of cooking the steak one by one. It follows a step-by-step approach defining each action that needs to be taken to cook the steak. This is a characteristic of imperative programming, where the focus is on the specific instructions and actions required to achieve a desired result.


# Example 2:
The provided example is a declarative programming paradigm.
The cooking process is a structured data, in the form of an array of steps, each describing an action.
The specific actions and their details are defined without stating the sequence or control flow of the cooking process. The code does not include a step-by-step instructions for control flow, such as conditional statements, to carry out the cooking process.
It relies on the defined data structure to guide the execution.
The code follows a declarative approach by abstracting the cooking process into a structured representation and focusing on the description of the desired outcome, rather than the detailed sequence of steps required to achieve that outcome.
